# Hiroshima Bot - Server Nuker (Remake)

Hiroshima Bot is a Discord bot designed to perform server moderation tasks, including deleting channels, roles, emojis, and stickers. It also offers options to ban all members, change their nicknames, and reset the server's name and icon.

> **Warning:** This bot performs destructive actions (nuking a server) and should be used responsibly and only in servers where you have permission to perform these actions.

## Features

- **Change Server Name and Icon**: Change the server's name and icon to custom values.
- **Delete Channels and Roles**: Delete all user-created channels and roles (excluding \`@everyone\`).
- **Delete Emojis and Stickers**: Delete all custom emojis and stickers.
- **Ban Everyone**: Ban all members in the guild except the bot.
- **Change Nicknames**: Change all member nicknames to "Meow" (or any other name you specify).

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)

   git clone https://github.com/drowning14/hiroshima-remake.git
   cd hiroshima-remake
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   Ensure you have Node.js installed. If you donâ€™t have the required dependencies installed, the bot will automatically install them for you.

   ```env
   token="YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE"
   ```

   > Make sure to replace \`YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE\` with your actual bot token from the Discord Developer Portal.
